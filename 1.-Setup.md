## Download and Install a Virtual Machine

[Download CentOS 8 VM Image](https://www.linuxvmimages.com/images/centos-8/) [1.0 - 2.5 GB]

[Download Ubuntu 19.19 VM Image](https://www.linuxvmimages.com/images/ubuntu-1910/) [4 GB]

There are more Virtual Machines as mentioned above, you can choice as you like. 

However, Linux VMs are most commonly used because they are open source.

You can also use a local machine with manipulating the IP-Address.

## Install Python or Java on your local machine or VM

[Download PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac) for Python Programming

[Download IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/) for Java Programming

## 1. Step for Client Server Communication with Python Sockets

Step-1: Install and Check Python on client and server machines
Python installation on Server Machine:
Login to Server machine, open terminal and run the following command:

> _sudo yum install python_

Enter root password (if asked), press ‘y’ for download and follow on screen instructions till the installation is complete. Upon, completion run the following command to check version of installed python:

> _python −−version_

The console will display the version of python after successfull installation. Subsequently, write a simple “Hello World” Program. Execute this program to check if python codes are executing successfully. Open an editor such as ‘vi’ or ‘gedit’ and create a new file named ‘hello.py’ using:

> _vi hello.py_

The above command will create a new file with extension ‘py’. ‘py’ extension represents a python file. Terminal will open the vi editor to write content to the file. Write the following line in the hello.py file:

> _print (‘Hello World!’)_

Press ‘Esc’, then write ‘:wq’ on the vi editor console to write and exit the file.

On console execute the hello.py file using following command:

> _python hello.py_

If the python code is executed successfully, the terminal will display the text line:

> _Hello World!_

Python installation on Client Machine:
Now, Login to Client machine with Ubuntu Desktop Operating System, open terminal and run the following command:

> _sudo apt-get install python_

Enter root password (if asked), press ‘y’ for download and follow on screen instructions till the installation is complete. Upon, completion run the following command to check version of installed python:

> _python −−version_

If python is successfully installed, console will certainly display the version of the installed python. Write and execute a simple Hello World Program to check if python program are executing successfully. Open an editor such as ‘vi’ or ‘gedit’ and create a new file named ‘hello.py’ using:

> _vi hello.py_

The above command will create a new file with extension ‘py’. “.py” exptesnion represents python file. The terminal will open the vi editor to write content to the file. Write the following line in the hello.py file:

> _print (‘Hello World!!’)_

Press ‘Esc’, then write ‘:wq’ on the vi editor console to write and exit the file.

On console execute the hello.py file using following command:

> _python hello.py_

If the python code is executed successfully, the terminal will certainly display the following text line:

> _Hello World!!_

## Step-2: Setup Network Communication between client and server machines

Certainly, the two machines should be on same network. That is to say that the two machines would be connected with wire using a cable, hub, or switch. Alternatively, the Two machines may also be connected through wi-fi modem as a wireless network connection with each other. Most importantly, the two machines should have same series of IP addresses to respond to each other’s ping messages.

### Network Setup on Server Machine:

The server machine would be identified by a unique IP Address (192.168.1.2 in our example) on a network.

Login to Server Machine. Go to Network Settings. Select IPV4 settings. Change IPV4 method from automatic to Manual and enter following network details:

> Address: 192.168.1.2

> Subnet: 255.255.255.0

> Gateway: 192.168.1.1

> DNS: Automatic

> Routes: Automatic

Apply the new settings and exit. Open terminal and check the IP address using following command:

> ifconfig

Certainly, the above saved network configurations would be displayed in terminal.

### Network Setup on Client Machine:

Each client machine will be identified by a unique IP Address (192.168.1.3 in our example) on a network. Login to Client Machine. Go to Network Settings. Select IPV4 settings. Change IPV4 method from automatic to Manual and enter following network details:

> Address: 192.168.1.3

> Subnet: 255.255.255.0

> Gateway: 192.168.1.1

> DNS: Automatic

> Routes: Automatic

Subsequently, apply the new settings and exit. Open terminal and check the IP address using following command:

> ifconfig

Certainly, the above saved network configurations would be displayed in terminal.

### Check Communication between Client and Server Machine:

Open terminal on client machine and type the following:

> ping 192.168.1.2

If a proper ping reply without any error is received, it firstly means that client machine is able to send an ICMP message to server machine. Secondly, the client machine is getting back a reply from the server machine successfully.

Now, open terminal in server machine and type the following command:

> ping 192.168.1.3

If a proper ping reply without any error is received, it firstly means server machine is able to send an ICMP message to client machine. Secondly, the server machine is getting back a reply from the client machine successfully.

The following image display a successful client server network communication.
